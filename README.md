# That Crazy Faker
That Crazy Faker is a Ruby on Rails app that generates funny Faker data. Users can enjoy reading them, and can generate new posts too.

##Directions for running That Crazy Faker locally:
Note: For BEGINNER devs, albeit familiar enough with RoR
1) bundle install --without production
	1) [TO UNDO] bundle uninstall gemname
2) rails db:migrate
	2) [TO UNDO] rails db:rollback
3) rails test
4) rails s(erver)

It's one of my first Rails apps from my General Assembly course back in 2016, and explores what the Faker Rails gem offers developers in randomly generated data.

I'd love for folks new to Ruby on Rails to clone this repo to their heart's content and see how great Faker is. There are other gems that generates random data but I like this one because it's pretty straightforward. One of my former instructors was a contributor to the gem too, which is cool.

##Directions for installing the gem can be found on the [Stympy Faker page](https://github.com/stympy/faker).
