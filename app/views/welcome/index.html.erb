      From RubyGems.org: "The software package is called a “gem” and contains a package Ruby application or library. Gems can be used to extend or modify functionality in Ruby applications.

    I hope you enjoy reading all the blog posts as much as I did.

    <p>Btw, you can <%= link_to "generate your own addition", "posts#new" %>
    to the Faker posts if you're feeling the <em>hipster</em>, <em>hacker</em>, or
    <em>Star Wars</em> vibe!</p>
